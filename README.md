<h2>👩‍💻 About Me</h2>

Hi, my name is Monica Muller!
<br>
<br>
I enjoy solving problems, helping others, and always having more to learn. Shortly after graduating with my bachelor’s degree, I realized that my initial career choice was not the right fit for me. After speaking with others and exploring different industries, I found my way into Information Technology, where I quickly developed a strong interest in networking due to its blend of problem-solving, structure, and real-world impact.
<br>
<br>
Through my current role, I have gained hands-on technical experience while supporting users across cloud-based platforms. In my current role as a Client Support Specialist, I regularly work with networking-related concepts such as DNS configuration (including creating and validating CNAME records for email domain authentication), troubleshooting connectivity, latency, and performance issues, and managing user access controls and permissions from a security perspective.
<br>
<br>
As part of my career development, I earned the CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications and am currently preparing for the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA). Alongside my studies, I maintain a GitHub portfolio where I document networking projects to reinforce what I’m learning and demonstrate my growing networking skill set.
<br>
<br>
I’m excited to continue building my experience in networking and to take the next step into a role where I can contribute to and learn from real-world network environments.
